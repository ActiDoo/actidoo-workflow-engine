# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

## Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0 (see `LICENSE`).

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This repository uses **CLA Assistant** to collect confirmations that contributors accept the CLA terms in `CLA.md`.

How it works:

1. Open a pull request.
2. If you have not signed yet, the bot will comment on the PR with instructions.
3. To sign, reply with the exact phrase:

   `I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA`

If you have already signed and the check still fails, comment:

`recheck`

## Privacy (CLA Assistant)

This repository uses CLA Assistant to record CLA confirmations for contributions. This creates a small record (e.g. your GitHub username and the fact that you signed) in a separate signatures branch configured by the workflow.
